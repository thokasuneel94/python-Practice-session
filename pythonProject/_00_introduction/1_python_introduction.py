# python :

# it is a very easy programming language which contains the features of both c and java.
# it is a open source software( anybody can freely download it from www.python.org ).
# it is a general purpose high level programming language ( human understandable language ).
# it is a dynamically typed programmimng language ( not assign the data type ).

# history of python :

# python was developed by guido van rossum in the year 1991.
# rossum picked the name python from the tv show monty python's flying circus.
# python first working version was ready by early 1990.

# the logo of python shows two intertwined snakes.

# features of python :

# it is simple and easy to learn.
# it is free ware and open source.
# it is a high level programming language.
# it is a platform independent ( write once and run anywhere by using pvm ).
# it is portable ( when a program yields the same results on any computer in the world ).
# it has a interpreter ( source code-->compiler-->byte code(pvm)-->interpreter-->machine code(binary code) ).
# it is extensible ( other language programs used in python ).
# it is embeddable ( we can use python programs in any other languages ).
# it has a huge library.
# it is both procedure oriented and object oriented language.
# batteries included, database connectivity, scalable, scripting language.

# where we can use python :

# desktop applications, web applications, database applications, networking applications.
# games, data analysis, machine learning,ai.

# limitations of python:

# it is not suitable for large scale enterprise applications.
# it is not used in mobile applications.

# flavors of python :

# cpython ( used with c language applications ).
# jython ( used with java language applications ).
# ironpython ( used with .net, c sharp applications ).
# pypy ( pypy programs run very fast since there is a jit( just in time ) compiler added to the pvm ).
# stacklesspython ( we can create threads and tasklets ).
# rubypython ( used with ruby type applications )
# anacondapython ( to handle big data ).
# pythonxy.

# why learn python :

# python works on different platforms (windows, mac, linux, raspberry pi, etc).
# python has a simple syntax similar to the english language.
# python on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
# python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programmimg languages.
# vast community support.
# tons of free modules and packages to help in every aspect of development.

# syntax of python :

print("Hello World")


def Hello(a,b):
    print(a*b)
    return "hello"


print(Hello(16,67))
